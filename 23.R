## 23. Extraction and Reconstruction:
## Extract the first and third elements from the vector created in question 5, storing them in a new
## object. How would you use this new object along with the original vector (minus its first and
## third elements) to reconstruct the original sequence?

## vector from 5.R
v5 <- c(
  6.00,
  7.00,
  8.00,
  9.00,
  10.00,
  11.00,
  12.00,
  5.30,
  5.30,
  5.30,-3.00,
  102.00,
  101.75,
  101.50,
  101.25,
  101.00,
  100.75,
  100.50 ,
  100.25,
  100.00
)

## Extract the first and third elements
first_third <- v5[c(1, 3)]
first_third

## Reconstruct the original sequence
reconstructed <- c(first_third[1], v5[-c(1, 3)], first_third[2])
reconstructed

## We then use the c() function to combine the extracted elements and the modified original vector, reconstructing the original sequence.
